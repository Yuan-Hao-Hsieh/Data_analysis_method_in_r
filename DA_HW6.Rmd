### Problem 1(a) : Implement a FA function

#### **Input**: 

- Data matrix `data`
- Selected number of factors `num_factors`
- Boolean `scale_data`: if `TRUE`,use correlation matrix, if `FALSE`, use covariance matrix.

#### **Output**: 

- Loading matrix $\textbf{A}$:representing the weight of each variable on each factor.
- Factor score matrix $\textbf{F}$: scores for each observation across the extracted factors.
- Communality vector \(h_i^2\) :total variance in variable \(i\) explained by the factors
- Uniqueness vector \(\psi_i\): residual variance in variable \(i\) not explained by the factors
- Proportion of variance explained by each factor

```{r}
# Define a custom Factor Analysis function
fa_function <- function(data, num_factors, scale_data = TRUE) {
  
  if (scale_data) {
    X <- scale(data)
  } else {
    X <- data
  }
  
  # Compute the correlation matrix 
  R <- cor(X)
  
  # Perform eigen-decomposition of the correlation matrix
  eigen_R <- eigen(R)
  eigenvalues <- eigen_R$values
  eigenvectors <- eigen_R$vectors
  
  # Select the top 'num_factors' eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
  # Compute the loading matri A by scaling the eigenvectors with the square     roots of the eigenvalues.
  
  A <- diag(sqrt(eigenvalues[1:num_factors])) %*%  
    t(eigenvectors[, 1:num_factors])
    
  # Compute communalities : for each variable, sum of squared loadings across factors.
  
  communalities <- colSums(A^2)
  
  # Compute uniquenesses : residual (variable-specific) variance that is not explained by the factors.
  # For a correlation matrix, the total variance for each variable is 1.

  uniquenesses <- 1 - communalities
  
  # Calculate the proportion of variance explained by each factor.
  # For a correlation matrix, the total variance is equal to the number of variables.
  p <- ncol(data)
  prop_variance <- eigenvalues[1:num_factors] / p
  
  # Factor score computation using the regression (Thomson) method.
  # The formula is:
  #     F = X_std %*% B, where
  #     B = psi_inv %*% A %*% solve(t(A) %*% psi_inv %*% A)
  # psi_inv is a diagonal matrix with the reciprocal uniquenesses.
  psi_inv <- diag(1 / uniquenesses)
  B <- psi_inv %*% t(A) %*% solve(A %*% psi_inv %*% t(A))
  
  
  # Compute factor scores for all observations.
  factor_scores <- X %*% B
  
  # Return all calculated outputs in a list
  return(list(
    loadings = t(A),
    factor_scores = factor_scores,
    communalities = t(communalities),
    uniquenesses = t(uniquenesses),
    prop_variance = prop_variance
  ))
}
```

### Problem 1(b) Apply your FA function to the AutoMPG dataset using 2 factors.
```{r}
# Load AutoMPG 
AutoMPG <- mtcars[, c("mpg", "cyl", "disp", "hp", "drat", "wt", "qsec")]
fa_result <- fa_function(AutoMPG,2)
Loading  <- fa_result$loadings
rownames(Loading) <- c("mpg", "cyl", "disp", "hp", "drat", "wt", "qsec")
colnames(Loading) <- c("a_1i","a_2i")
Loading
factor_scores <- fa_result$factor_scores
colnames(factor_scores) <- c("factor1","factor2")
factor_scores
communalities <- fa_result$communalities
colnames(communalities) <- c("mpg", "cyl", "disp", "hp", "drat", "wt", "qsec")
communalities
uniquenesses <- fa_result$uniquenesses
colnames(uniquenesses) <- c("mpg", "cyl", "disp", "hp", "drat", "wt", "qsec")
uniquenesses
fa_result$prop_variance
```
### Observation 

- In PCA, the first PC1 is to explain about 72% of the total variance of the data, while the factor1 is almost explain  the same 72% of the total varaince.

- FA can see the communalites and the uniquess of each feature, while PCA can not see these details. 

### Problem 2
  Transpose the ORL face dataset to let 𝐗 be a 2576 × 400 data matrix. Perform the factor analysis on 𝐗 withthe FA function of your implementation in EX1. 

#### (a) Determine the number of factors required to explain at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% of the total variance in the transposed ORL dataset.

- Convert the 400 images into a 400 × 2576 data matrix and add an additional column indicating the physical gender label.
```{r}
library(png)
image_dir <- "D:/DA_HW/DAHW/ORL Faces"
image_files <- list.files(image_dir, pattern = "\\.png$", full.names = TRUE)
n <- length(image_files)
if(n != 400){
  stop("Expected 400 images, but found ", n)
}
data_matrix <- matrix(NA, nrow = n, ncol = 46 * 56)
for (i in 1:n) {
  img <- readPNG(image_files[i])
  data_matrix[i, ] <- as.vector(t(img))
}
```

- Factor analysis, and build the thresholds to determine the numbers of factors.

```{r}
X <- t(data_matrix)
X_std <- scale(X)

# Compute the correlation matrix of the 400 variables (images)
R <- cor(X_std)

# Perform eigen decomposition
eigen_R <- eigen(R)
eigenvalues <- eigen_R$values

# The total variance in a correlation matrix is equal to the number of variables.
total_variance <- ncol(X_std)  

# Compute cumulative proportion of variance explained by the factors.
cum_prop <- cumsum(eigenvalues) / total_variance

# Define the thresholds 
thresholds <- c(0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)

# For each threshold, determine the minimum number of factors required.
factors_required <- sapply(thresholds, function(t) {
  min(which(cum_prop >= t))
})

# Print results
results <- data.frame(
  Threshold = thresholds,
  NumFactors = factors_required,
  CumulativeVariance = cum_prop[factors_required]
)
print(results)

```
#### (b)Assuming 80% of the total variance is explained, rescale the first extracted factor to the range [0, 255]. Then, reshape the 2576 × 1 vector into a 46 × 56 matrix and visualize it as a grayscale image. 

```{r}
num_factors_80 <- factors_required[which(thresholds == 0.8)]

# Run FA on the transposed ORL dataset X with num_factors_80 factors.
fa_results <- fa_function(X, num_factors = num_factors_80)

# Extract the first factor score vector (2576 x 1)
first_factor <- fa_results$factor_scores[, 1]

# Rescale the first factor to the range [0, 255]
first_factor_scaled <- (first_factor - min(first_factor)) / (max(first_factor) - min(first_factor)) * 255

# Reshape the 2576-length vector into a 46 x 56 matrix.
# Depending on the order (row-major or column-major) you prefer, adjust the 'byrow' parameter.
face_matrix <- matrix(first_factor_scaled, nrow = 46, ncol = 56, byrow = TRUE)

# Visualize the matrix as a grayscale image.
# The image() function plots using a default orientation, so you may adjust the axes if needed.
image(face_matrix,
      col = gray.colors(256, start = 0, end = 1),
      main = "Rescaled First Factor as a Grayscale Image",
      xlab = "Pixel Column", ylab = "Pixel Row")
```

### Problem 3 Use a suitable package or library to perform Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) on the AutoMPG dataset.Randomly select 300 cars to build the model, and use the remaining 92 cars for testing.

#### Import dataset and split
```{r}
library(readxl)
auto_mpg <- read_excel("Auto-mpg/auto-mpg.xlsx")
colnames(auto_mpg)
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
n <- nrow(auto_mpg)
train_index <- sample(1:n, size = 300) # Randomly select the train data
train <- auto_mpg[train_index,]
test <- auto_mpg[-train_index,]
```

### (a) Univariate PLRS : y = mpg
```{R}
library(pls)
# Fit the PLSR model with cross-validation to help choose the number of components.
fit_univ <- plsr(mpg ~ cylinders + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration + `model year` + origin, data = train, validation = "CV")

# RMSEP() returns the cross-validated error; the optimal ncomp minimizes this error.
univ_rmsep <- RMSEP(fit_univ)
# The RMSEP object has a 'val' component. The first entry (ncomp=0) is the baseline.
# Find the index (number of components) that minimizes RMSEP for mpg.
optimal_univ <- which.min(univ_rmsep$val[1,1 ,1:8]) - 1
cat("Optimal number of components (univariate):", optimal_univ, "\n")

# Predict mpg for the test set using the chosen number of components.
pred_univ <- predict(fit_univ, newdata = test, ncomp = optimal_univ)
# Compute the Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP) on the test set.
rmsep_univ <- sqrt(mean((test$mpg - pred_univ)^2))
cat("Test RMSEP (univariate mpg):", rmsep_univ, "\n")
```
### (b) Extend the response variable to a multivariate case: 𝑦 = [mpg model year]. Analyze the model’s test performance and specifically compare the predicted mpg results between this multivariate case and the univariate case in part (a).

```{r}
fit_multi <- plsr(cbind(mpg, `model year`) ~ cylinders + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration + origin, 
                  data = train, validation = "CV")

# Determine the optimal number of components based on the response "mpg".
# RMSEP for multivariate responses is returned for each response.
multi_rmsep <- RMSEP(fit_multi)
# We select the number of components minimizing the RMSEP for mpg.
optimal_multi <- which.min(univ_rmsep$val[1,1 ,1:7]) - 1
cat("Optimal number of components (multivariate):", optimal_multi, "\n")

# Predict the responses for the test set using the chosen number of components.
pred_multi <- predict(fit_multi, newdata = test, ncomp = optimal_multi)


# We take the first response (mpg); the second response is model.year.
pred_multi_mpg <- pred_multi[, "mpg", ]

# Compute RMSEP for mpg from the multivariate model.
rmsep_multi <- sqrt(mean((test$mpg - pred_multi_mpg)^2))
cat("Test RMSEP (multivariate, mpg):", rmsep_multi, "\n")
```
### Discussion

#### Univariate PLSR Model:

- Uses mpg as the sole response variable.

- Cross-validation determines the optimal number of latent components to minimize RMSEP.

- The test set RMSEP for mpg is calculated directly from the univariate model predictions.

#### Multivariate PLSR Model:

- Models mpg together with `model year` as joint responses.

- Optimal components are chosen based on minimizing the RMSEP for predicting mpg.

- The model extracts shared variance between mpg and `model year`, which could benefit the predictive accuracy for mpg.

#### Comparison of Results:
- Both models are compared primarily using the `RMSEP` for mpg predictions on the test set.

- The univariate model's RMSEP is lower, it indicates that including model.year might add unnecessary complexity or noise.

- The difference in the optimal number of components between the two approaches also provides insight into model complexity and the latent structure captured by each method.
